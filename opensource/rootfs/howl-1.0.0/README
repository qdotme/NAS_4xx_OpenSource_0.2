Version 0.7.2
=============
Known issues 
- the FreeBSD port does not yet include autoipd and nifd.
- mDNSResponder does not respond with a probe when sent a
  conflicting probe in response to a device's previous 
  query.

Changes since the previous release (0.7)
- mDNSResponder can run on a single interface
- Addressed Issues
	- 	autoipd changed ip address when pinged from another
		machine
	- 	nifd complains of failure to restart the network 
  		interface on an ad-hoc network.  The deamons behave
  		appropriately in spite of this message.
	- 	ifup did not always restore the default routes on a 
		LAN when started by nifd, therefore, reconnecting 
		after disconnecting required running ifdown and 
		ifup on the interface
