Overview

   libdaemon is a lightweight C library that eases the writing of UNIX
   daemons. It consists of the following parts:
     * A wrapper around fork() which does the correct daemonization
       procedure of a process
     * A wrapper around syslog() for simpler and compatible log output to
       Syslog or STDERR
     * An API for writing PID files
     * An API for serializing UNIX signals into a pipe for usage with
       select() or poll()
     * An API for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR redirected
       to syslog.

   APIs like these are used in most daemon software available. It is not
   that simple to get it done right and code duplication is not a goal.

   libdaemon is currently used by [22]ifplugd, [23]Avahi, [24]ivam2,
   [25]Nautilus-Share and [26]aeswepd.

Current Status

   Version 0.12 is feature complete.

Documentation

   An extensive API reference is [27]available

Requirements

   libdaemon was developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux "testing" from
   July 2003, it should work on most other Linux distributions (and some
   Unix versions) since it uses GNU Autoconf and GNU libtool for source
   code configuration and shared library management.

   libdaemon is known to work on modern Linux systems, FreeBSD, NetBSD,
   OpenBSD, Darwin, Solaris and Windows/Cygwin.

Installation

   As this package is made with the GNU autotools you should run
   ./configure inside the distribution directory for configuring the
   source tree. After that you should run make for compilation and make
   install (as root) for installation of libdaemon.

   Please use gmake instead of traditional make for compilation on
   non-Linux systems.

Acknowledgements

   Sebastien Estienne, for a lot of portability work.
