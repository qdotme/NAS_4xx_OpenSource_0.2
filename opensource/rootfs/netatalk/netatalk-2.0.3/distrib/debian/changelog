netatalk (1.5pre8cvs-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Unofficial CVS release.
  * Correct included docs, since all platform specific docs were merged.
  * Upstream does now have manpages for apple_cp(1), apple_mv(1), and
    apple_rm(1), written by Lance Levsen <l.levsen@printwest.com>.
    Removed the links to undocumented(7).
  * Don't supply --with-did=last anymore, since this is now the default.
  * Added cnid_didname_verify(1) to list of undocumented binaries.

netatalk (1.5pre8-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Appletalk -> AppleTalk in package short descriptions. Thanks to Matt
    Zimmerman and his spell checking effort for pointing this out.
  * Really install README.Debian this time.
  * Removed afppasswd and afppasswd(1) from Debian distribution, since
    they are of no use when SSL support is not compiled in.

 -- Sebastian Rittau <srittau@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Nov 2001 15:13:53 +0100

netatalk (1.5pre8-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed uams_pam.so. (Closes: #118889)
  * Explain why we don't link against OpenSSL in README.Debian.
  * Modified debian/rules so that setting a variable called USE_SSL to
    "yes" enables SSL support. This should ease the local compilation of
    SSL-enabled netatalk packages.

 -- Sebastian Rittau <srittau@debian.org>  Sat, 10 Nov 2001 19:05:12 +0100

netatalk (1.5pre8-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected upstream version number (pre8 instead of pre7). This corrects
    afpd -v and similar commands.
  * Raised default number of allowed afpd clients. Suggestion by Jonas
    Smedegaard.
  * Small logcheck fix by Jonas.
  * Removed ATALK_BACKGROUND description from netatalk.conf(5).
  * Removed obsolete --with-config-dir configure option.

 -- Sebastian Rittau <srittau@debian.org>  Sat, 27 Oct 2001 15:36:30 +0200

netatalk (1.5pre8-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Work around the fact that upstream includes sym-links to mkinstalldirs and
    missing instead of verbatim copies. We do that by including our own copies
    in debian and copy them before running the build. (Closes: #114915)

 -- Sebastian Rittau <srittau@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Oct 2001 14:03:34 +0200

netatalk (1.5pre7-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * More patches by Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>:

      Logcheck fixes and improvements. (Closes: #114448)
    + 005_visible_home_dir_in_config_(again!)
      Name user home directories "Home Directory" by default to make them
      appear in the MacOS chooser. (Patch had already been applied in
      1.5pre7-2, but had been lost since.)
    + Jonas made more patches, which I haven't applied yet, but either
      committed upstream or sent upstream for discussion.

      Not applied, but patched config/netatalk.pamd to strip /lib/security
      from its path.

netatalk (1.5pre7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Integrated a lot of patches by Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>:
    + 001_etc2ps paths
      Correct paths in etc2ps and suggest tetex-base.
    + 005_visible_home_dir_in_config
      Name user home directories "Home Directory" by default to make them
      appear in the MacOS chooser.
    + 007_logcheck
      Support for the logcheck log file checking package.
    + 011_avoid_symlinks_and_force_using_autoconf_2.50
      Partly applied: Patch configure.in so that the use of autoconf 2.50
      is forced. (Debian autoconf hack workaround.)
    + 012_netatalk.conf
      Improved init script. Also, make use of netatalk.conf again.
      I patched the patch so that netatalk.conf is placed in /etc/default.
    + 015_recommend_lsof_(for_macusers)_and_suggest_quota
      Recommend lsof and suggest quota.
    + 021_enable_ssl_and_cracklib_and_correct_pam_paths
      Partly applied: Enable cracklib support.
  * Fixed paths in add_netatalk_printer.
  * Removed lp2pap.sh since it's of no use on Debian systems.
  * Removed test_parse_mtab and afpd-mtab.pl because we are not using
    the mtab DID scheme.
  * Comparison operator is '=', not '==' in the 'test' command. Fixed
    my patch.
  * Removed netatalk.conf.5 as well, since we don't install netatalk.conf
    anymore.
  * Removed superfluous file /etc/netatalk/netatalk.pamd.
  * Moved all *.la and *.a files to netatalk-dev. Added appropriate
    conflicts and replaces.
  * debian/rules: Do not copy files to package build directories instead of
    removing them afterwards.

netatalk (1.5pre7-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version. Most patches were applied upstream.
  * This release uses libtool for UAM stuff. Also, the correct flag
    for dynamic linking is supplied, so the problems with unresolved
    symbols should be gone now. (Closes: #95399)
  * Non-DSFG free code was removed. Copyright notice was changed accordingly.
  * Use ./configure --sysconfdir instead of --with-config-dir.
  * Upstream package does now install PAM file in the correct directory.
    Removed rule, correcting this from Debian rules file.
  * Added man pages for netatalk-config(1) and timelord(8). (Upstream
    does now also include a man page for timeout(1), but since we're not
    distributing it anymore, we don't care.)
  * Some doc files were removed, others were added.
  * Use debhelper compatibility level 3 and performed general packaging
    cleanups at the same time.
  * Standards-Version 3.5.6.0. No changes needed.
  * Netatalk is now GPL'ed. Added a note stating that to copyright.
    Also, we can't link against libssl anymore. Removed SSL stuff.
    I had to patch configure.in to do that.
  * Removed emacs stuff from changelog.
  * Applied a patch to getiface.c for a problem that could lead to
    segfaults. Thanks to Kai Henningsen <kaih@khms.westfalen.de>
    for actually being affected by this bug, and - more importantly -
    finding the problem. (Closes: #109310)

  * Cleaned up CFLAGS handling in ./configure call.
  * Updated config.{sub,guess} again, just to make sure ...
  * Depend on the timeout package from tct. Also, don't distribute
    /usr/bin/timeout and remove the timeout(1) link to undocumented(7).
    Make preparations to remove the proper timeout(1) man page that will
    get distributed with netatalk 1.5pre7.

  * Applied patch which adds a command-line option to disable
    CR/LF translation (thanks to Davide Welton and Jon Nelson).
    (Note to release manager: this patch is applied so this
     package has the exact functionality of netatalk-asun)
  * Renamed libatalk-dev to libatalk1-dev.
  * Symlinked /usr/man/man1/nbpunrgstr.1.gz to /usr/man/man1/nbprgstr.1.gz
    to keep lintian happy.
  * Changed the "lock directory" to /var/run and the names of the "lock files" to <foo>.pid,
    since what the source calls locks are really the same as the .pid files other daemons
    put in /var/run.
  * This package provides all the functionality of netatalk-asun, and
    it will replace netatalk-asun in the distribution.

    Note that configuration files that make use of this feature may not
    work with other releases of netatalk, and that this feature may be

    differently.
  * Startup messages now conform to 'Standard for Console Messages' (fixes

netatalk (1.4b2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to upstream version 1.4b2.
  * Added preliminary PAM support (currently disabled).
  * Made /etc/init.d/netatalk a conffile.
  * Changed /etc/init.d/netatalk to complete only once appletalk services
    are running.  Configurating an Appletalk interface can take many (> 15)
    seconds, so the previous version would fork a process to configure the
    interface and then start up the other Appletalk services.  Although
    possibly controversial, this change is necessary so that packages like
    ppr can be ensured that netatalk will be started before they run
    without undue complication.
