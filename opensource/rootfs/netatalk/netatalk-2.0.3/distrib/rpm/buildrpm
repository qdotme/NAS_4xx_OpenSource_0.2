# automates the process of building the netatalk rpm

# To properly bootstrap the RPM from a raw CVS pull,
# place the CVS sandbox under, e.g. /usr/src/redhat/BUILD
# and name this new directory 'netatalk-$version' (where
# $version is the contents of the 'VERSION' file under the source
# root).  Then, cd into the source root and run 'autogen.sh'
# (with no arguments).  Finally, copy this file to the BUILD
# directory and run it from there, passing the full name of the
# source directory as the sole argument.
