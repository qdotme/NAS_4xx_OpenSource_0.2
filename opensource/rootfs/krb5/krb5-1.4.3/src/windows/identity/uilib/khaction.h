    current cursor context.  Specifically, these identify several
    special cases of credential selection, such as the selection of an
    entire identity, a credential type or a single credential.  If
    none of these are applicable, then the generic scope identifier
    ::KHUI_SCOPE_GROUP is set or ::KHUI_SCOPE_NONE if there is nothing
    selected.

    Note that the scope typically only apply to cursor contexts and
    not the selection context.  Please see 
    \ref khui_context "UI Contexts" for more information.
