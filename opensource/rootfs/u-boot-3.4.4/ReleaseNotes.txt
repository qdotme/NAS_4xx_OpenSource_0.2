3. How to build U-Boot
======================

   -) Download U-Boot release 1.1.4 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/u-boot.

   -) Update the U-Boot 1.1.4 release by copying the patch of this release.
   
   -) Update the U-Boot Makefile to point to the cross compiler in your host
      machine, arm-none-linux-gnueabi cross compiler.

   -) Build the U-Boot binaries as follows:

 
   -) For DB-88F6281-BP LE
   > make mrproper
   -) NAND
   > make db88f6281abp_config NBOOT=1 LE=1
   -) SPI
   > make db88f6281abp_config SPIBOOT=1 LE=1
   > make -s

   -) For DB-88F6192A-BP LE
   > make mrproper
   -) NAND
   > make db88f6192abp_config NBOOT=1 LE=1
   -) SPI
   > make db88f6192abp_config SPIBOOT=1 LE=1
   > make -s

   -) For RD-88F6281A LE
   > make mrproper
   -) NAND
   > make rd88f6281a_config NBOOT=1 LE=1
   -) SPI
   > make rd88f6281a_config SPIBOOT=1 LE=1
   > make -s

   -) For RD-88F6192A LE
   > make mrproper
   -) SPI
   > make rd88f6192a_config SPIBOOT=1 LE=1
   > make -s

* For BE use BE=1

   -) The BootRom header files are located in the source root directory:
	-> dramregs_400_A.txt
	-> dramregs_200rd_A.txt
	-> dramregs_200db_A.txt
      The files have predefined register settings for the different SDRAM configurations and required errata. 
      The matching header file is appended to the U-boot image during the make process according to the device
      and board type, using the doimage utility which is located in the /tools directory. The output file to be
      burnt on boot ROM depends on the make parameters:
	-> NBOOT=1 : u-boot-<board name>_<SDRAM clock frequency>_nand.bin
	-> SPIBOOT=1 : u-boot-<board name>_<SDRAM clock frequency>_flash.bin
	
      The file u-boot-<board name>_<SDRAM clock frequency>_uart.bin is used for debug purposes for booting the 
      U-boot image through the UART port.
