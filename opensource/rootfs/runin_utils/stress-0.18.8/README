INSTALL

See the INSTALL file for generic installation instructions.  The quick
version is:

  % ./configure && make
  # make install

USAGE

You can see the program's usage statement by invoking it with --help.  A
manual is available, run:

  % info stress

or visit:

NOTES

This program works really well for me, but it might not have some of the
features that you want.  If you would like, please extend the code and send
me the patch[1].  Enjoy the program :-)

Please use the context diff format.  That is: save the original program
as stress.c.orig, then make and test your desired changes to stress.c, then
run 'diff -u stress.c.orig stress.c' to produce a context patch.  Thanks.
