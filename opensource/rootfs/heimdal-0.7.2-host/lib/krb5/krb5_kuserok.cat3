     This function takes the name of a local _u_s_e_r and checks if _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_a_l is
     allowed to log in as that user.

     The _u_s_e_r may have a _~_/_._k_5_l_o_g_i_n file listing principals that are allowed
     to login as that user. If that file does not exist, all principals with a
     first component identical to the username, and a realm considered local,
     are allowed access.

     The _._k_5_l_o_g_i_n file must contain one principal per line, be owned by _u_s_e_r,
     and not be writable by group or other (but must be readable by anyone).

     Note that if the file exists, no implicit access rights are given to
     _u_s_e_r@<localrealm>.

     Optionally, a set of files may be put in a directory), in which case they
     will all be checked in the same manner as The files may be called
     anything, but files starting with a hash _~_/_._k_5_l_o_g_i_n_._d (``'' or ending
     with a tilde ``(~'') are ignored. Subdirectories are not traversed. Note
     that this directory may not be checked by other implementations.

     kkrrbb55__kkuusseerrookk returns TRUE if access should be granted, FALSE otherwise.
