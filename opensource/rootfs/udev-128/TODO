These things would be nice to have:
  o get all distros to agree on a default set of rules
  o rework rules to a match-action list, instead of a rules array

These things will change in future udev versions:
  o log warning if the kernel uses CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED*=y,
    which means that /sys/class/block/ does not exist
  o DEVTYPE for disks is set by the kernel, they will be removed from
    the default rules
  o "udevadm control" commands will only accept the --<command> syntax
  o symlink names to udevadm will no longer be resolved to old command names
