This is what I had to do to get it to work for me. Your mileage may vary.

     - Some versions of Apple's cpp doesn't like configure. 

        - run 'gcc_select' to see what version you are using, and
          'gcc_select -l' to list available versions. I've had success with
          3.3, selected by running (as root) 'gcc_select 3.3'. (Note: this was
          on Pather, 10.3.2)

      - tcpTable and udpTable are broken.

        * ./configure --with-out-mib-modules="mibII/tcpTable mibII/udpTable"

When starting the agent, I get an error about nlist not finding icmpstat, but
the agent runs and returns data.

If this doesn't work for you, or you have fixes for any of the above tables,
please post to <net-snmp-coders@lists.sourceforge.net>. Thanks!
